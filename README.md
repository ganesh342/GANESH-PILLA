the language used is c++


program-1: create a class and take the inputs and call the functions in the class accordingly

program-2: Iterate through two loops in outer loop iterate through a and inner loop iterate through i and increment val by 2

program-3: same like program2 but only update if it is odd else print the previous one

program-4: Take the n value and all the array values and check for the divisibility and increment the freq array and display it
